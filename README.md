### NearBadger and Frensly projects

NearBadger is the platform that allows users to prove that they own a profile in a given web3 social platform (such as Lens Protocol, Farcaster, Mirror...), by providing an intuitive and simple User Interface, where users have to sign a message with their EVM-based wallet and save the signature to their Near account in order to prove other users that they own a given handle

Frensly is one of the platforms that leverages NearBadger tools to create a unique social platform on Near Protocol where users owning a Lens Profile can get to know and interact with other users owning a verified Lens Profile on Near Protocol in a fancy and cozy environment
